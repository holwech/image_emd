# ImageEMD
Empirical Mode Decomposition for images, 2D matrices or other bidimensional data.

This library is written for Python 3.+ and utilizes solutions presented in different algorithms like Image Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD), Bidirectional Empirical Mode Decomposition (BEMD) and Directional Empirical Mode Decomposition (DEMD). ImageEMD uses the MatLab engine to run morphological operators, thus some installation of MatLab and the Python API is required for this package to run.
